### Iteration 0 - Comp setup
Objective - we were given a prebuilt project where our goal was to improve on accessibility, refactor and dry up code. We wanted to create classes with appropriate repositories for those class, as well. Overall, our goal was to improve upon the code while maintaining the site's appearance and intended functionality.

### Iteration 1 - Data & Users
Objectives - Create a `User` repository and complete TDD by adding functionality to the `User` class. Read through scripts.js to add information (such as query selectors and event listeners) to the DOM.
1. Create a `User` class repository for each user object that was given in the user.js file.
2. Created TDD and methods for the `User` class.
3. Added information to the DOM using scripts.js.
